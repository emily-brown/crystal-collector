### Link to Live Game:

## Game Objective:
Using the buttons that hold hidden value, score points to tie with the Computer's random number.

### Game Instructions:
1. Begin game by pressing the "Random!" button. The number will display under the Computer's Number. 
2. Using the four (4) buttons, click away until your number, which is displayed under "Player Number" matches the Computer's Number. The catch is though that the values of each button are hidden and the value of each changes every round. 
3. If you match the computer's number, you gain a point and the game resets with a new computer number and new hidden value buttons. If you go over, you lose a point and the game resets.
